### Description
The library implements a discrete-time Additive Unscented Kalman Filter, based on the paper **2015_Menegaz et al, A Systematization of the Unscented Kalman Filter Theory**. 
The implementation followed the **Unscented Transformation** and **Sigma Representation** concepts. The four Sigma Representations done by far are: 

- Sigma representation of Julier 1995 (Table I, 1);
- Homogenemous Minumum Symmetric Sigma Representation(Corollary 4);
- Rho Minimum Sigma Representation(Corollary 5);
- Even Minumum Symmetric Sigma Representation(Corollary 3);

((Table I, x) means that the sigma representation definition is on the paper Table 1, and x means which row is at)

### Steps for downloading the library

- Clone the library in a desired directory;
- If you have a GitHub account, you can download the zip file directly in the repository or you can clone directly in the       desired folder, using the git clone <clone-link> commmand;
    
Each language folder has it own README.txt explaining how to use and with documentation.
